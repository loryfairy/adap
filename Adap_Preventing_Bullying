Adap for Bullying Prevention in Schools

Overview

Adap is an AI architecture designed to foster safer, more ethical, and inclusive school environments. In this module, Adap acts as a monitoring and prevention system for bullying, integrating with digital platforms used by students and school administrators. The goal is to detect suspected bullying situations and support school management in decision-making, without emotionally exposing those involved.

Main Features

1. Intelligent Communication Monitoring
- Integration of Adap’s AI with chats, apps, and educational virtual environments.
- Automatic detection of aggressive language patterns, insults, social exclusion, and other bullying signals in both group and private conversations.

2. Discreet Alerts for School Staff
- Automatic alerts are generated and sent only to the responsible pedagogical staff (teachers, coordinators, counselors).
- Alerts include the context of the incident (class, virtual room, group) but do not expose names to the entire school community.
- Enables rapid intervention according to the institution’s internal protocol.

3. Reports for School Management
- Creation of anonymous and statistical reports on the incidence of possible bullying cases by environment, class, or period.
- Guidance on where to focus preventive campaigns or educational actions based on trends identified by AI.
- Training suggestions for teachers and staff.

4. Privacy and Security
- Guarantee of student anonymity in reports and alerts, according to legislation and best data protection practices.
- Restricted access controls: only authorized personnel can view and analyze detailed alerts and reports.

Example Workflow

1. A group of students uses aggressive language in a school chat.
2. Adap detects terms and patterns associated with bullying and logs the incident.
3. The pedagogical team receives a discreet alert with the context of the incident (e.g., “possible case of aggressive language detected in 7B class chat”).
4. The school can investigate and intervene according to its code of conduct, without publicly exposing students.

Benefits

- Reduction of bullying cases through early detection and preventive actions.
- Increased safety and inclusion in the school environment.
- Support for school management with concrete data while respecting everyone’s privacy.
- Adaptable tool for different platforms and school realities.

Next Steps

- Develop the integration module with school communication platforms.
- Validate the system in a pilot environment, adjusting detection rules and standards.
- Train school staff for proper analysis and use of reports and alerts.
